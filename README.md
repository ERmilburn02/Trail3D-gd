# Trail3D

A 3D Trail Renderer for Godot

## Install Instructions

Download the repo, and add it to your addons folder.

## Usage instructions

Add the `Trail3D` node to your scene and set it up with a width curve and a material. There is a material provided, `Trail_Unlit`, if you want a simple solution.

## Acknowledgements

This project was forked from [Trail3D](https://github.com/bar-ji/Trail3D). The main difference is that this fork uses GDScript instead of C#, to allow for better support on all platforms.
